Description: widgets for tracking KJob instances - data files
 Window class that associates this job with a window given by
 window. This is used by KDialogJobUiDelegate as parent widget
 for error messages, KWidgetJobTracker as parent widget for
 progress dialogs, KIO::AbstractJobInteractionInterface as
 parent widget for rename/skip dialogs and possibly more.
 Overload that takes a QWindow.
